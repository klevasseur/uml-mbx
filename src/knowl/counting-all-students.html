</h5>
<p>The number of students in a class could be determined by adding the numbers of students who are freshmen, sophomores, juniors, and seniors, and those who belong to none of these categories. However, you probably couldn't add the students by major, since some students may have double majors.

Assume the number in each course was was 75, 60 and 55, respectively for the three courses listed. Further investigation indicated ten juniors took all three courses, twenty-five took Algorithms and Logic Design, twelve took Algorithms and Compiler Construction, and fifteen took Logic Design and Compiler Construction.

<p><a knowl="./knowl/student-counting-disjoint.html" knowl-id="xref-student-counting-disjoint" alt="Example 1.1.5 Counting Students in Disjoint Classes." title="Example 1.1.5 Counting Students in Disjoint Classes.">1.1.5</a> was a simple application of the law of addition, however in this example some students are taking two or more courses, so a simple application of the law of addition would lead to double or triple counting. We rephrase information in the language of sets to describe the situation more explicitly.
</p>
<p>
 \(A\) = the set of all junior computer science majors
</p>
<p>
  \(A_1\) = the set of all junior computer science majors who took Algorithms
</p>
<p>
  \(A_2\) = the set of all junior computer science majors who took Logic Design
</p>
<p>
  \(A_3\) = the set of all junior computer science majors who took Compiler Construction
</p>
<p>
 Since all sophomore CS majors must take at least one of the courses, the number we want is:
 <span class="displaymath" id="me-3">\[\lvert A \rvert = \lvert A_1 \cup A_2 \cup A_3 \rvert = \lvert A_1 \rvert + \lvert A_2 \rvert + \lvert A_3 \rvert - \textrm{repeats}.\]</span>
</p>
<p>
 A Venn diagram is helpful to visualize the problem. In this case the universal set \(U\)  can stand for any reasonable set, for example, the set of all students in the university.

 We see that the whole universal set is naturally partitioned into subsets that are labeled by the numbers 1 through 8, and the set \(A\)  is  partitioned into subsets labeled 1 through 7. The region labeled 8 represents all students who are not junior CS majors.  Note also that students in the subsets labeled 2,3, and 4 are double counted, and those in the subset labeled 1 are triple counted. To adjust, we must subtract the numbers in regions 2, 3 and 4.  This can be done by subtracting the numbers in the intersections of each pair of sets.  However, the individuals in region 1 will have been removed three times, just as they had been originally added three times.  Therefore, we must finally add the numbers in
