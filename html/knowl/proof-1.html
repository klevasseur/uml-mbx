 is one-to-one and onto.  To do so, it is convenient for us to use the relation notation, where \(f(s)=t\)
 is equivalent to \((s,t)\in f\).</p><p>To prove that \(f\) is one-to-one, assume that \(f(a)=f(b) = c\).  Alternatively, that means \((a, c)\)
 and \((b, c)\) are elements of \(f\).  We must show that \(a=b\).  
 	 <span class="displaymath" id="me-6">\[(a, b), (c, b) \in  f \Rightarrow  (c, a), (c,b) \in f^{-1}\]</span>
By the fact that \(f^{-1}\) is a function and \(c\) cannot have two images, \(a\) and \(b\)  must be equal, so \(f\) is one-to-one. </p><p>Next, to prove that \(f\) is onto, observe that for \(f^{-1}\) to be a function, it must use all of its domain, namely \(A\).  Let \(b\) be any element of \(A\). Then \(b\) has an image under  \(f^{-1}\), \(f^{-1}(b)\). Another way of writing this is \((b,f^{-1}(b)) \in f^{-1}\), By the definition of the inverse, this is equivalent to \((f^{-1}(b),b) \in f\). Hence, \(b\) is in the range of \(f\).  Since \(b\) was chosen arbitrarily, this shows that the range of \(f\) must be all of \(A\) and so \(f\) is onto.</p><p>  \(\Rightarrow\)  Assume \(f\) is one-to-one and onto and we are to prove \(f^{-1}\) exists. We leave this half of the proof to the reader. \(\blacksquare\)</p></article><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="context-link" style="text-align:right;"><a href="theorem.html#proof-1">(in-context)</a></div>
